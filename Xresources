!! .Xresources
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!! Provides resource settings for use in the Xrdb database (as opposed to
!! .Xdefaults, which is loaded simply by Xlib on application startup).  This
!! file is supposed to support "high" DPI and the plain boring old DPI that *NIX
!! has always supported.
!!
!! Note that this file consists solely of preprocessor directives.  The
!! reasoning here is that if xrdb happens to not support preprocessing, this
!! file should do nothing, rather than half the job.  Do not add resource
!! statements here directly.  Instead, keep high-DPI settings in that file, and
!! all other settings in the (Xlib) .Xdefaults file, which is nicer for
!! troubleshooting.
