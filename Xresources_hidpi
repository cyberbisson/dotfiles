!! The following section tries different settings for various monitors to make
!! high resolution displays a little nicer.

!! - 5K iMac is 5120x2880.
!! - Retina iMac 2880x1800.
!!
!! Note:
!! - Specify DPI setting in multiples of 96 if possible.
!! - If DPI does not work, likely Infinality (LCD hinting software) has
!!   overridden it, so use the .scale resource.
